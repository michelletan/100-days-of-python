# Day 023 - Turtle Crossing

Task: Recreate the game of Frogger

## Game Requirements
1. Turtle moves forwards when the "Up" key is pressed. It can only move forwards.
2. Cars are randomly generated across the y-axis and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.
3. When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the original position and the player levels up. On the next level, the car speed increases.
4. When the turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everything stops.
